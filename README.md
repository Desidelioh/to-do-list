# to-do-list
I built a To Do List web application that allows the user to input a task description and add it to the lis.
I added a prompt message that alerts and prevents the user from adding empty tasks to the list.
I designed a clear and user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS where the tasks are displayed with check icons and cross-out lines when completed.
I also added a functional X button to delete tasks.
